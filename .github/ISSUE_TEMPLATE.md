 ## Summary

 A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

 1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
1. **I want** [goal of the story]
1. **so that** [reason for the story]

 ### Description

 We’re using the following template to create user stories.

 Since we have mentioned the type of user, the user story can refer to it with “I”.
This is useful for **consistency** and to **avoid repetition** in the Acceptance criteria.
It’s also good to practice a little **empathy**.

 For example:

 ```markdown
1. I click on the “submit” button.
1. A modal window appears if I don’t have enough credits.
1. The modal window contains the following:
  1. […]
```

 ## AcceptanceCriteria

 1. [If I do A.]
1. [B should happen.]

 [
Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

 1. Constraint 1;
1. Constraint 2;
1. Constraint 3.
